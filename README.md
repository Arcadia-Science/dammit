# dammit!

![dammit](doc/Character_Building.png)

dammit! is a simple de novo transcriptome annotator. It was born out of the
observation that annotation is mundane and annoying, all the pieces of the process
exist already, and the existing solutions are overly complicated or rely on
crappy software. Science shouldn't suck for the sake of sucking, so dammit attempts
to make this sucky part of the process suck a little less.
